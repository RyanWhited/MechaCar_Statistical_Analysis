# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
  ![Deliverable 1](https://github.com/RyanWhited/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/images/Deliverable1.jpg)
  - Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
    - vehicle_length and ground_clearance both provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg.
  - Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
      - We can reject the null hypothesis that the slope of the linear model is not zero because Multiple R-squared value is 0.7149 and the p-value is below the confidence level of 0.05. 
  - Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
      - Yes because 71% (the r-squared value) of predictions will be correct using this linear model.
